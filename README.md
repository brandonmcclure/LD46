# LD46
My entry into Ludam Dare 46. I am going to write it using as much PHP as I can. The theme is `Keep it alive`. The idea around my game is that you are traveling through space and you find a creature floating around that has grown attached with you and is dependent on you for survival. You move from place to place and try to keep it alive.
