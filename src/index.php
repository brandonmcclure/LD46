<p>As you play the game you will need to take action on the "random" events that occur. Your goal is to keep your creature feed/alive. Your creature will have 1 of 4 possible food types. The random events that occur may have food available, or they may not, so you have to learn the patterns of which events you should feed your creature at and which you should avoid.</p>
