Have some ideas down on paper. A basic "snake" type game where you need to keep "it" alive and loose lifeforce over time would be cool. IDK how to do animation, will need client scripting for that, so also thinking a text based game would be cool. 

Maybe you are a vet and you need to keep "it" alive, but all you have is a silloute and some vague info, then you select a habitat, food, and some recreation for it to do. You either kill it or not....


Had an idea that rips off of Seedship for android and my current fav No Mans Sky. You have to keep a ship alive over a long journey. would be text based. Think of a organic starship that could grow/evolve as you go, or you could totally kill it.

Basics for a state machine and repositories to get strings and random events. I am still torn between the last 2 ideas, but I think this is a good foundation. Coming from .net this seems to be a pretty easy transition although right now my app is only bouncing between a 2 states, and is throwing errors. :-)

Got the mechanics for feeding the creature working and cleaned up the look (and the code a bit). Started working on how I will deploy, attempting through Azure. 

I need to expand the different types of food you can give, and add some more events that will be a threat to the creature. some extra attributes on the creature would be good as well. I think a relationship indicator for you. 

Stretch goals would be to setup some more randomness in which strings are selected/how descriptions are given. Also some better css/graphic design.

TODO: 
* change Source code link css to like the home button

* when displaying the creature name, sometimes it is capital, sometimes it is not.
